# Tadanime

Tadanime is a proof of concept of a decentralized anime rating Web application.
It makes use of Linked Open Data to display information of the anime to the user.
It uses a user's Solid POD to get the user's ratings of anime.
Thus, no server-side logic is required for the application
as both the information about the anime and the personal information of the user
is stored on different servers.

Check the [live version](https://pheyvaer.github.io/tadanime/index.html) or the [screencast](https://streamable.com/e0qje).

## What you can do

- login with your Solid POD
- browse through a couple of randomly loaded anime
- browse through your anime
- update the rating of anime
- search in anime that is loaded
- add new anime based on URL (based on Linked Data principles)
